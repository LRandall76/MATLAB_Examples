# MATLAB_Profession_Examples
Examples of My Code Writing Ability in Matlab.

All of these files fit together to achieve a common goal and that is to obtain the highest accuracy when forecasting the electrical load.
Within these examples, I used genetic algorithms, wavelet decompoisition, and other tactics to optimize accuracy. This was my more earlier 
work in researching and is not as refined as my python code, but still accomplishes its goal well. Attached are a few outputs of these functions
as jpgs and also xlsx files.
